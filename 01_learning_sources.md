# Activities to do and learn from
There are three lists in here. 

- "Active learning sources", are my actual sources of knowledge. There shouldn't be many of these. They should have 
an start date and a expected finalization date. I should have a git project for each one, correctly named, 
with their own notes, cheatsheets, exercises and projects. Once finalized I should generate anki notes from them, 
correctly tagged.

- "Closed learning sources", are finished sources with a finished date. There should be general notes generated over 
them in form of anki notes. I should be doing repetitive learning with these material.

- "I want to learn from these", a growing list of interesting materials. I shouldn't be learning nothing from this list.
  I should focus on the previous ones.
